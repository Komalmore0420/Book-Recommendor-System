# Book-Recommendor-System
The main objective of this project is to develop book recommendation systems by Collaborative filtering method.

Libraries Used:
ipython-notebook - Python Text Editor
sklearn - Machine learning library
numpy -  python library
pandas - data handling library


There are 2 main types of book recommendation systems:
Collaborative Vs Content based filteringContent based filtering
Recommendations are based on user's past likes/ dislikes & item feature space. The system makes recommendations which are similar to items the user has liked in the past. Items are considered similar based on item's features such as author, publisher, genre etc.
Collaborative based filtering
Recommendations are based solely on user's past likes/ dislikes & how other users have rated other items. The system does not take into consideration an item's features like author, publisher, genre etc nor a user's features like age, gender, location etc. These take either a memory based approach or a model based approach.

In this project, we will use the Collaborative based filtering method to build a book recommender system.
